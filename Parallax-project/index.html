            <h2 class="secheading">Adventure Time</h2>
            <p class="text">“Adventure” this word itself is an invitation to massive adrenaline rush, number of emotions such as excitement, fear, nervousness, thrill & danger are felt all at once on thinking about it. Technically, adventure is an unusual & daring experience. People usually go for an adventure trip in their leisure time so as to revive their spirit after utterly exhausting schedule of routine life.
                <br> <br>
                While the definition of adventure can vary from person to person, in broader context “risk taken when its outcome is unknown” can be termed as adventure. It is something that challenges you, it is something that lets you escape from your ordinary lives & thus it is something that changes you. Adventures can be sought in numerous ways such as mountaineering, river rafting, trekking, skydiving, scuba diving, etc.

                Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, such as air or coil-sprung shocks used as suspension, larger and wider wheels and tires, stronger frame materials, and mechanically or hydraulically actuated disc brakes. 
                <br> <br>
                Mountain bikers ride on off-road trails such as singletrack, back-country roads, wider bike park trails, fire roads, and some advanced trails are designed with jumps, berms, and drop-offs to add excitement to the trail. Riders with enduro and downhill bikes will often visit ski resorts that stay open in the summer to ride downhill-specific trails, using the ski lifts to return to the top with their bikes.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is a sport in which the players fly in the air using paragliders. These paragliders are light in weight and are foot launched. There is a harness in the glider on which the paraglider sits. This harness is interconnected to the glider with baffled cells. We will learn various aspects of this adventurous in the chapters that follow.
              
                <br> <br>
                Paragliding demands jumping from high heels and to ski in the air for long hours. Therefore, a hill station having a stiff peak and a wide area for surfing in the air will be a suitable environment. If it will be played in any normal crowded area, then it is obvious that the user will face difficulty while paragliding.

                <p class="text">
                    Surfing has been a sport enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people around the world.   It originated in Polynesian culture as a religious ceremony mainly practiced by the royalty.   Having been introduced from the Hawaiian Islands roughly 60 years ago, it has become a common practice in virtually every coastal beach break throughout the USA and numerous places around the globe.

                    Surfing is the sport of riding waves in an upright or prone position. Surfers catch the ocean, river, or man-made waves and glide across the surface of the water until they break and lose their energy.
                    In the ocean, wave riders stand up on surfboards and navigate the water - nearly parallel to the beach - toward the shore.
